            This section discusses <strong>errors</strong> from a
            <strong>TEM perspective</strong>. One of the premises in TEM is that
            errors, as portrayed by traditional views on human error, do not
            properly reflect the <strong></strong>realities of an operational environment</strong>. 
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-green-500">
            ^^^ <strong>Dev Media:</strong> Use the Error Icon developed at the start of the course to indicate that the focus of this page is on the Error aspect of TEM. Yellow background with error icon centre and top.
          </p>

          <p>
            ATCOs do
            not adopt courses of action merely by choosing between a good and a
            bad outcome. Rather they adopt courses of action that seem to be the
            best in the light of their <strong>training, experience and understanding of            the situation</strong>. They make sense of the operational situation in which they are
            immersed, based on cues and clues provided by the <strong>context of the            scenario</strong> they are dealing with.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-green-500">
            ^^^ <strong>Dev Media:</strong> The key aspect here is to show the difference between choice based on good or bad and choice with multiple factors. The Dialogue card in H5P allows a nice flip card effect without much development effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            <del>
              Only afterwards, when the result of
              such attempt at making sense is known (the outcome), is it possible
              to suggest, with the benefit of hindsight, that a different course
              of action would probably have resulted in a better outcome.
            </del>
          </p>
          <p>
            <del>
              In cases where the outcome was an undesirable one, the attempt at
              making sense leading to that outcome is usually classified as an
              "error". This can only be done when the outcome is known (which is
              not the case when the deliberation took place) and when additional
              information about the context of the situation is available (which
              was not available to the people attempting to make sense of the
              situation at the time) that suggests another course of action may
              have been more appropriate than the one taken.
            </del>
          </p>
          <p>
            If the outcome of their actions is undesirable, the decision making leading to that outcome is usually classified as an "error". However, this can only be done once the outcome is known and benefits from hindsight. Analysing the decision after the outcome means there is additional contextual information about the situation. This extra information was not available to the ATCO at the time they made the decisions.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-blue-500">^^^ <strong>Dev Text:</strong> I think that some of the text is redundant as it repeats points. Sentences are also long and grammatically complex. I've suggested a simplification that would need to be checked by the SME to ensure the meaning hasn't changed.</p>
          
          <p class="text-green-500">^^^ <strong>Dev Media:</strong> I would make this a custom interaction instead of a H5P flip card as above as I want to emphasise the change to more contextual information. It would be an photo with graphics and labels showing a limited context. The learner selects a toggle to go from before the outcome to after and the context is increased in the graphic.</p>
          

          <p>
            This applies to <strong>equipment handling</strong> errors, <strong>procedural</strong> errors and/or
            <strong>communication</strong> errors. When the equipment is handled, the procedure
            is applied or the communication takes place, the people involved are
            convinced that what they're doing is the best thing (or at least the
            correct thing) to do in that situation. It is not until afterwards
            that it is possible to see that perhaps the equipment should have
            been handled differently, or that another procedure should have been
            applied, or that the communication was not adequate.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-green-500">^^^ <strong>Dev Media:</strong> Ask the learner to consider situations like this that may have happened in their workplace. What wider contexts were available after the fact? Then allow the learner to reveal and example scenario. The SME would have to provide the scenario.</p>

          <p>
            All of this begs the question - <strong>"Why was this additional information not available to the controller at the time of the event?"</strong> Among the
            various answers, the one that is relevant to TEM is that they were
            <strong>not actively engaged</strong> in the <strong>identification of threats</strong>.</p>
            
            <p class="text-green-500">^^^ <strong>Dev Media:</strong> Threat icon with bold design highlighting of question and mirror format for answer.</p>
            
            <p>Threats are
            such an <strong>integral and embedded</strong> part of a controllers job that they
            are <strong>routinely handled without a second thought</strong>. Through extended
            exposure to a threat-rich environment, ATCOs have learned to live
            with threats as a normal part of the job. Yet, for all this
            <strong>"normalisation"</strong> of threats, mismanaged threats continue to hold
            their full safety-damaging <strong>potential</strong>.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-green-500">^^^ <strong>Dev Media:</strong> Ops room image with threats icons spread around.</p>

          <p>
            Under TEM, a threat is not a problem in and of itself, but it could
            develop into one if not <strong>managed</strong> properly. Not every threat leads to
            an error, and not every error leads to an undesired state, yet the
            <strong>potential</strong> is there and should be recognised.
            
            
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, visitors
            to an ATC operations room are a "threat": their presence in itself
            is not a dangerous situation, but if the visitors engage in
            discussions with the ATC team or otherwise distract them, they might
            lead the controller to make an error. 
            </p>
          <p>
            Recognising this situation as  a threat will enable the controllers to manage it accordingly,
            thereby minimising or preventing any distraction and thus not
            allowing the safety margins in the operational context to be
            reduced.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-green-500">^^^ <strong>Dev Media:</strong> I would spend time on this media as it illustrates the core TEM concept of being aware of and managing threats.
            
            </p>
          <p class="text-green-500">
            This storyboard offers two alternative media options for this section.One is a video and one a set of images. If there was time available, the video would have more impact but the images would also be effective and time saving.
            </p>
          <p class="text-green-500">
            
            <strong>Video</strong>: the above could be a 'sliding doors' style video where the screen is split in two. The scenes start off the same with visitors entering the ops room and each scenario identified as a 'threat that ATCO automatically handles but still potential'. On the left side, the visitors stay back and are quiet. On the right hand scenario, visitors are distracting and even interact with the controller. An error then occurs and potential realised.
            </p>
          <p class="text-green-500"><strong>Image set:</strong> static images illustrating the above.</p>

          <p>
            Specific examples of errors in air traffic control from the
            perspective of TEM are listed below.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-green-500">&#x2193;&#x2193;&#x2193; <strong>Dev Media:</strong> To help the learner engage and remember these examples, they could be transformed into a simple interaction where they have to match each bullet point to the correct error category.
            
            </p>
          
          <p class="text-green-500">
            I would see if this is feasible  in H5P first (a lot of text can be problematic on mobile screens sometimes with H5P content). If that's not possible, I'd make a very simple custom interaction.</p>
          
          <p class="text-green-500">
            It could be useful to add a reveal of the correct answer to make it easier for the learner to read the final text.
