          <p>
            This section discusses errors from a
            <strong>TEM perspective</strong>. One of the premises in TEM is that
            errors, as portrayed by traditional views on human error, do not
            properly reflect the
            <strong>realities of operational environment</strong>. ATCOs do not
            adopt courses of action merely by choosing between a good and a bad
            outcome. Rather they adopt courses of action that seem to be the
            best in the light of their
            <strong>
              best in the light of their training, experience and understanding
              of the situation best in the light of their </strong
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            They make sense of the operational situation in which they are
            immersed, based on cues and clues provided by the context of the
            scenario they are dealing with. Only afterwards, when the result of
            such attempt at making sense is known (the outcome), is it possible
            to suggest, with the benefit of hindsight, that a different course
            of action would probably have resulted in a better outcome.
          </p>

          <p>
            In cases where the outcome was an undesirable one, the attempt at
            making sense leading to that outcome is usually classified as an
            “error”. This can only be done when the outcome is known (which is
            not the case when the deliberation took place) and when additional
            information about the context of the situation is available (which
            was not available to the people attempting to make sense of the
            situation at the time) that suggests another course of action may
            have been more appropriate than the one taken.
          </p>

          <p>
            This applies to equipment handling errors, procedural errors and/or
            communication errors. When the equipment is handled, the procedure
            is applied or the communication takes place, the people involved are
            convinced that what they're doing is the best thing (or at least the
            correct thing) to do in that situation. It is not until afterwards
            that it is possible to see that perhaps the equipment should have
            been handled differently, or that another procedure should have been
            applied, or that the communication was not adequate.
          </p>

          <p>
            All of this begs the question - “Why was this additional information
            not available to the controller at the time of the event?” Among the
            various answers, the one that is relevant to TEM is that they were
            not actively engaged in the identification of threats. Threats are
            such an integral and embedded part of a controllers job that they
            are routinely handled without a second thought. Through extended
            exposure to a threat-rich environment, ATCOs have learned to live
            with threats as a normal part of the job. Yet, for all this
            “normalisation” of threats, mismanaged threats continue to hold
            their full safety-damaging potential.
          </p>

          <p>
            Under TEM, a threat is not a problem in and of itself, but it could
            develop into one if not managed properly. Not every threat leads to
            an error, and not every error leads to an undesired state, yet the
            potential is there and should be recognised. For example, visitors
            to an ATC operations room are a “threat”: their presence in itself
            is not a dangerous situation, but if the visitors engage in
            discussions with the ATC team or otherwise distract them, they might
            lead the controller to make an error. Recognising this situation as
            a threat will enable the controllers to manage it accordingly,
            thereby minimising or preventing any distraction and thus not
            allowing the safety margins in the operational context to be
            reduced.
          </p>

            Specific examples of errors in air traffic control from the
            perspective of TEM are listed below.
