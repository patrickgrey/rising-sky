            In this section we are going to look briefly at the
            <strong>different types of drones</strong> that can be flown, the
            main components of a drone, the principles of flight and how you can
            check that your drone is ready to fly.
          </p>
          <h2>Is it a drone?</h2>
          <p>
            There are many different types of drones that are available on the
            market or can be built. They can generally be divided up into:
          </p>

          <h3>Fixed wing drones</h3>
          <p>
            They can be used recreationally but often are used by businesses
            that need their drone to fly longer distances and cover large areas
            (e.g. doing thermal imaging of large fields). As a fixed wing drone
            moves through the air, the wings carry the weight of the body and
            the propellers simply propel the drone forward. So, it needs far
            less power than rotor wing drones that have to suspend the craft in
            the air using propeller power alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fixed-wing drones usually come in one of three different styles:

          <h3>Rotary wing drones</h3>

          <p>
            The basic structure of a rotary wing drone is a fixed body (the
            rotor) with a number of rotor blades that revolve around a fixed
            mast. There are a number of different rotor configurations. These
            are the most typical ones, however there are many variations
            available:

            Each configuration has their own unique characteristic advantages
            and disadvantages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rotary drones are controlled by varying the thrust and torque of the
            rotors. The biggest advantage of rotary drones is that they can
            takeoff and land vertically (although admittedly some fixed wing
            drones can also do this). This allows the remote pilot to launch in
            a small space. Their ability to hover and carry out small airborne
            movements, make them ideal for photography, filming and inspections
            where precision manoeuvring is needed.
          </p>

          <h3>Hybrids</h3>

          <p>
            A hybrid drone can fly like a fixed wing drone and it can also hover
            like a rotary wing drone. This is the best of both worlds as it
            combines the stability and manoeuvrability of a rotary wing drone
            with the speed and fuel efficiency of a fixed wing drone.

          <h2>Aero models and drones</h2>
          <p>
            Although the regulation covers both aero models and drones, there
            are some differences between the two.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aeromodel pilots and drone pilots very often fly for very different
            reasons and are motivated by different impulses. Notwithstanding the
            differences between aero models and drones, aero models have to
            respect the same obligations.

                  Flight is made possible when air comes in contact with
                  wings/propellers and lift is generated.

                  With rotor wing drones, lift is generated solely by the
                  propeller. In this case, the weight is then directly
                  compensated for by the lift generated by the propeller;

                your drone.

            Now that we have looked at the principles behind how drones fly, we
            are going to consider how the drone is able to move in any
            direction. It does this by rotating about in three dimensions. This
            is called the drones axes of rotation.

          <h2>Command and Control</h2>

          <h3 class="black-heading">Overview</h3>

          <p>
            Remember that the formal term for a drone is a UAS, which stands for
            Unmanned Aerial System. It includes both the vehicle (i.e. the
            drone), called the UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and the command,
            which is also sometimes called the RCS (Remote Control Station).
          </p>

          <p>
            The command unit is how the remote pilot ‘flies’ the drone. The
            command inputs are coded and transmitted to the drone via
            electromagnetic waves. The drone receives the electromagnetic waves,
            decodes them and sends the command signals to the computer and
            servos to control the motion.
          </p>

          <p>
            Often, the drone also transmits useful information (e.g. speed,
            altitude, position) back to the command via the same channel. This
            process is called ‘telemetry’.
          </p>

          <h3>Datalink frequencies and spectrums</h3>
          <p>
            Many drones are using frequencies of around 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz.
            These frequencies propagate in line of sight, which means that the
            command must ‘see’ the drone. So if there is an obstacle like tree
            or building in-between, the signal could be lost.
          </p>
          <img
          loading="lazy"

            alt="Datalink frequencies and spectrums"
            title="Datalink frequencies and spectrums"
          />
          <p>
            To insure the optimum transmission of the signals from the command,
            the antennas (if equipped) should be positioned in the way the
            manufacturer’s user manual indicates. This is usually with an angle
            of between 60° and 90°, without crossing the antennas.

            The frequency selection is made automatically by the system to
            minimise interference and to maximise the system performance. Some
            command devices allow you to manually select the frequency to be
            used, however, this option is more typically used for quite specific
            applications and its use is not recommended.

          <h3 class="black-heading">Flight modes</h3>

          <p>
            Modern drones, whether they are toys or not, are assisted by a
            computer and sensors. This helps considerably to stabilise the
            flight under various circumstances (e.g. in windy conditions). But
            remember that if one or more of these assistance systems fail on
            your drone, it will be much more difficult to fly!
          </p>
          <p>
            Aeromodels, which are more basic and lack such assistance, are
            usually much more difficult to fly.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are a number of different modes that a drone can be flow in:

            You are allowed to fly your drone at night but to do this, the drone
            must have at least one green flashing light on it.

            In aviation, of which drone flying is a part, night is clearly
            defined. At our latitude
            <strong>night starts 30 minutes after sunset</strong> and continues
            <strong>until 30 minutes before sunrise</strong>.
