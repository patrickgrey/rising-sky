        <p>You can view this panel on the home page of the <a href="https://learningzone.eurocontrol.int/" target="_blank">EUROCONTROL Aviation Learning Centre (ALC) Learning Zone</a>. </p>

        <p>There are logged in and logged out versions of this panel. Create a free account and log in to see the full panel</p>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>

        <p>Management at the ALC wanted to promote how <strong>popular</strong> the platform had become by prominently displaying 'engagement' statistics. For logged out learners, it would show general visitor statistics. Logged in learners would see stats relevant to their organisation and country.</p>

        <p>The panel needed to be attractive and show quite a lot of data while not taking up too much space on the home page.</p>

        <h2>Restrictions</h2>

        <p>The Learning Zone home page is created by the <a href="https://www.im-c.com/learning-suite/" target="_blank">IMC Learning Management System</a>. It is made up of 'panels' that cannot include data from the back-end. All the CSS and JavaScript in the panel can interact with the rest of the page ({% include "../../_shared/images/icons/icon-warning-filled.svg" %} Danger! Danger! {% include "../../_shared/images/icons/icon-warning-filled.svg" %})</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>

        <p>We created a panel template using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank">11ty</a>. During development we can see the results as a stand alone page. For production, only the HTML needed for the panel is output along with bundled and namespaced CSS and JavaScript.</p>

        <p>The panel uses semantic HTML and <strong>vanilla</strong> CSS and JavaScript - the default choice at Rising Sky.</p>

        <p>As we couldn't get the data from the back-end on load, the statistics are <strong>fetched from an API</strong>.</p>

        <p>The page is responsive along two axes: screen size and logged in status.</p>

        <p>For logged out users, the row showing user specific data is removed. For users on smaller screens, the globe is also removed, otherwise the panel would take up too much room, forcing learners to scroll more before getting to the content they need.</p>

        <h2>Features &amp; Code</h2>

        <p>To highlight the worldwide appeal of the platform, we decided to plot the number of visitors from each country. We used the open source WebGL generated globe, <a href="https://github.com/vasturiano/globe.gl" target="_blank">https://github.com/vasturiano/globe.gl</a>. This is relatively simple to use but the challenge was to add flags and plot the data.
