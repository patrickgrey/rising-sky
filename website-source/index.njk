<h2>Improve my accessibility skills</h2>

<h2>Improve my CSS</h2>

<p>CSS is high on my list as it seems to be evolving faster than the Pokemon my kids are obsessed with. There
    are many features I'm aware of but don't understand (same with Pokemon). CSS to do list:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1</li>
    <li>2</li>
    <li>3</li>
    <li>4</li>
</ul>

<h2>Web components</h2>
