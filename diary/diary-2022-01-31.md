Today I worked on the https://elpac.eurocontrol.int/ and https://feast-info.eurocontrol.int/ websites. These are fairly old template-based sites where the jQuery and Bootstrap versions were outdated.

jQuery updated from v3.3.7 to v4.6.1 without a hitch. Says alot about how amazing that library is.

After a quick review I thought the Bootstrap updates would take over a day as things broke when the bootstrap version was updated. This would therefore take some rebuilding of HTML and Javascript.

Turns out it took an hour and 20 lines of CSS. My ability to get estimates hugely wrong sometimes never ceases to amaze me! (And, yes, I only charged for the actual time taken, not my estimate).
