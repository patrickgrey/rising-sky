Last year we completed an (objectively) extremely successfull course about getting licenced to fly drones: [UAS A1 + A3] (https://learningzone.eurocontrol.int/ilp/pages/description.jsf?menuId=1106#/users/@self/catalogues/8264768/courses/10332476/description). Participation was huge and feedback was very positive.

We are now developing the second part of the course.

Found some time to work on the business site. I wanted to develop a hero feature that progressively enhances a div with a background image where an image description can be toggled on and off accessibly.

I got it working then, as I often found, had to rebuild it from scratch fixing the mistakes I'd made in my first approach. Great way to learn! The first build acts as a prototype where I realise the things I didn't initially consider. For example, what if the photo label had too much text? I hadn't designed the CSS 'defensively' so it couldn't cope. I didn't start from 'What if there's no javascript'. Amazing how designing that first simplifies the CSS, instead of bolting it on afterwards.

I rebuilt, focussing on the correct HTML structure (which happened to be greatly simplified) and my CSS was about halved - a result of more clarity of purpose.

I get great joy from deleting lines of code, knowing I've simplified things and made them easier to revisit and understand in future.
