Last year we completed an (objectively) extremely successfull course about getting licenced to fly drones: [UAS A1 + A3] (https://learningzone.eurocontrol.int/ilp/pages/description.jsf?menuId=1106#/users/@self/catalogues/8264768/courses/10332476/description). Participation was huge and feedback was very positive.

We are now developing the second part of the course.

Found some time to work on the business site. I wanted to develop a hero feature that progressively enhances a div with a background image where an image description can be toggled on and off accessibly.

I got it working then, as I often found, had to rebuild it from scratch fixing the mistakes I'd made in my first approach. Great way to learn!
