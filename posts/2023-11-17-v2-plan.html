<body>
    <p>It's mid November 2023 and it's cold, crisp and sunny. Most of the rest of the year is my own as my contract was
        fulfilled ahead of time. I want
        to use it to learn.</p>

    <p>CSS is high on my list as it seems to be evolving faster than the Pokemon my kids are obsessed with. There are
        many features I'm aware of but don't understand. I will start by looking at these resources:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1</li>
        <li>2</li>
        <li>3</li>
        <li>4</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Web Components are high on my list too. I totally changed my outlook on
        them based on this post by Eric Baily. I also used Shoelace on a projects and experienced the pros and cons.</p>

    <p>I also want to finally create my businesses website to replace the current holding page [screenshot here] -
        [versions by sub domain?] (now three years old). I have a vague idea what I want
        it to contain:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1</li>
        <li>2</li>
        <li>3</li>
        <li>4</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I want it to be a place where I control and keep my own stuff. I'm hoping that if I make the publish / edit
        process easy, I will publish more.</p>

    <p>I want as simple and robust a process as possible. Don't like MD. Want to be able to edit on mobile. Rejecting
        CMS.</p>
